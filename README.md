Overview
This project converts normal images into cartoon-style images using Python. It utilizes Gradio for a user-friendly interface and integrates with Hugging Face for machine learning model deployment.

File Structure
main.py: Main script to run the cartoon image generation.
requirements.txt: Contains the list of dependencies required to run the project.
utils.py: Utility functions used in the project for image processing.
model.py: Script that loads and processes the machine learning model for style transfer.
interface.py: Script that sets up the Gradio UI for interacting with the model.
Usage
Install Python 3.x and the required libraries from requirements.txt.
Clone or download the project repository.
Choose the appropriate script (main.py, interface.py) based on your use case.
Run the selected script to start the image conversion or interact with the UI.
Example Usage
For image conversion using the model:

bash
Copy code
python main.py --input_image path/to/image.jpg --output_image path/to/output.jpg
To launch the Gradio UI for interactive usage:

bash
Copy code
python interface.py
