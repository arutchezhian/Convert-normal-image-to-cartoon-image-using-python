<h2>Normal Image to Cartoon Image using Python</h2>
This project demonstrates how to convert normal images into cartoon-style images using Python. The notebook leverages tools like Gradio for a user-friendly interface and integrates with Hugging Face for machine learning model deployment.
Project Overview
PART I: Style Transfer with Gradio UI
This section covers setting up a simple web interface using Gradio to demonstrate the style transfer model.
Gradio is an open-source Python library that allows you to demo your machine learning model with a user-friendly web interface.
Installation
To get started, you'll need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/williamyang1991/VToonify.git $CODE_DIR

Install Dependencies
You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install gradio huggingface_hub

Additional Setup
Ensure you have the necessary models and datasets downloaded. You might need to configure Hugging Face for specific tasks.
Usage
After setting up your environment, you can run the notebook to start converting images to cartoon-style:

Bash

jupyter notebook Normal\ image\ to\ cartoon\ image\ using\ python.ipynb

Running the Gradio Interface
The Gradio interface can be launched directly from the notebook to visualize and interact with the style transfer model.
Notes
This project integrates with Hugging Face, a platform that provides tools to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
The style transfer is part of a broader project called VToonify, which you can explore for more advanced image-to-cartoon conversions.
